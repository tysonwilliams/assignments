            <h2>Background Info</h2>
            <p>Utah is a western U.S. state defined by its vast expanses of desert and the Wasatch Range mountains. Salt Lake City, the capital, is centered around Temple Square, headquarters of the Mormon Church and site of its majestic temple and tabernacle, with its massive dome and renowned choir. The Great Salt Lakeâ€™s buoyant waters attract swimmers and sunbathers, especially at Antelope Island State Park.</p>
